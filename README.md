### Frontend 
* Javascript
* React
* Redux
* Redux Saga
* React-Router
* Reselect 
* Redux Persist
* Sass
* Lazy Loading
* Jest and Enzyme

### Backend
* Node.js
* Express
* PostgreSQL
* Knex.js
* Moment.js

### App Features
* Users are able to register/login to create/edit/delete notes. 
* When a note is edited, the note will change from 'created' to 'modified' and the timestamp will update accordingly.
* Persist user application data using PostgreSQL.

### Focus
* Built a client-server model using React.js and Redux-Saga (client), Node.js and Express (server), and PostgreSQL (database) to create a full stack notepad application.
* Developed a REST API that can handle multiple client requests.
* Tested API routes with Postman.
* Handle asynchronous calls and manage application states with Redux-Saga.
* Using transactions in PostgreSQL to update multiple data tables at once within a single HTTP request.
* Build resuable/clean components with React and scaling the project with the use of Redux and Redux-Saga.
* Memoize functions with the Reselect Library.
* Implement React Router to build a single page application (SPA) without the page refreshing as the user navigates.
* Redux Persist is utilized to persist the application states.
* With Lazy Loading, the most critical components are loaded first, ultimately increasing the speed performance of the webpage.
* Unit Testing with Jest and Enzyme
